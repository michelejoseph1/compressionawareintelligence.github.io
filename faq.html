  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <p class="lede">Straight answers to the questions we hear most about CAI.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>What is CAI in one sentence?</summary>
      <p>Compression-Aware Intelligence is a framework for recognizing, measuring, and leveraging the distortions created by compression in AI systems, human cognition, and collective narratives, in order to improve reliability and accountability.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How is CAI different from typical AI safety or RAG approaches?</summary>
      <p>CAI treats compression as the root variable. It maps compression sites, scores their tension, attaches provenance, and enforces abstention if claims are not entailed. RAG is a retrieval pattern. CAI is a system contract that spans retrieval, verification, scoring, and audit.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can CAI guarantee zero hallucination?</summary>
      <p>For open-ended generation no. CAI can guarantee no unsupported claims only when outputs are restricted to verified evidence and the system abstains if entailment or thresholds fail.</p>
    </details>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Math and metrics</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>What is the Compression Tension Score?</summary>
      <p>A per-site metric that combines information loss, task degradation, provenance gaps, and uncertainty into a normalized score that estimates the cost of a compression step.</p>
      <p>See <a href="foundations.html">Foundations</a> for the equation and path aggregation.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you publish proofs or formal specs?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Start with the overview on Zenodo, then the Foundations page for equations and the reference pipeline.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Code and participation</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Where can I see code and working demos?</summary>
      <p>Prototype repos with compression tags live here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/michelejoseph/compression-aware-intelligence-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compression-aware-intelligence-demo</a></li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How can I get involved?</summary>
      <p>Open issues or pull requests on GitHub, propose evaluation datasets with tagged compression sites, or reach out for collaborations.</p>
