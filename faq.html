    <h2>basics</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>what is CAI in one sentence?</summary>
      <p>Compression-Aware Intelligence is a system contract that detects, scores, and governs the effects of compression at each step of an AI or human-information pipeline so that outputs stay within evidence and uncertainty is explicit.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>how is CAI different from RAG and typical safety approaches?</summary>
      <p>RAG retrieves. CAI governs. CAI maps compression sites, scores tension, attaches provenance, and enforces abstention if claims are not entailed. It spans retrieval, verification, scoring, and audit.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>can CAI guarantee zero hallucination?</summary>
      <p>for open ended generation no. CAI can guarantee no unsupported claims only when outputs are restricted to verified evidence and the system abstains if entailment or thresholds fail.</p>
    </details>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="myths">
    <h2>myths and comparisons</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>is CAI just Information Bottleneck?</summary>
      <p>no. IB studies representation sufficiency under a compression objective. CAI operationalizes compression sites across an end to end system with provenance, per step tension scoring, abstention policy, and audit surfaces. IB is an analysis lens. CAI is governance and execution.</p>
      <p>see <a href="foundations.html">Foundations</a> for the formal elements that CAI adds.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>is CAI just Schmidhuber style compression ideas?</summary>
      <p>prior work connects compression to learning and curiosity. CAI is different because it treats compression as an auditable variable with thresholds, provenance, and abstention that gate claims. the unit of analysis is the compression site with a measurable tension score.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>is CAI only for language models?</summary>
      <p>no. any pipeline that compresses information can be instrumented. examples include data cleaning, schema mapping, retrieval, summarization, tool use, and human review.</p>
    </details>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="metrics">
    <h2>metrics</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>what is the Compression Tension Score?</summary>
      <p>a normalized per site metric that combines information loss, task degradation, provenance gaps, and uncertainty. it estimates the risk cost of a compression step and feeds path aggregation.</p>
      <p>see <a href="foundations.html">Foundations</a> for the equation and aggregation.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>do you publish proofs or formal specs?</summary>
      <p>yes. start with the overview on zenodo, then the foundations page.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://zenodo.org/records/16467706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CAI overview</a></li>

  <section class="card" id="evaluation">
    <h2>evaluation</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>how do i evaluate CAI on my workload?</summary>
      <ol>
        <li>tag compression sites in your pipeline</li>
        <li>run baseline vs CAI gated</li>
        <li>measure accuracy, unsupported claim rate, abstention rate, mean time to review, and escalation patterns</li>
        <li>report per site tension distributions and path scores</li>
      </ol>
      <p>see <a href="benchmarks.html">Benchmarks</a> for a starter scorecard and tasks.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>what outcomes should improve with CAI?</summary>
      <p>lower unsupported claims at equal or better accuracy, calibrated abstention, faster human review through provenance, and simpler audit trails.</p>
    </details>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="code">
    <h2>code and demos</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>where can i see code and working demos?</summary>
      <p>prototype repos with compression tags live here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/michelejoseph/compression-aware-intelligence-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compression-aware-intelligence-demo</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>see <a href="implementations.html">Implementations</a> for integration patterns.</p>
    </details>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="privacy">
    <h2>privacy and governance</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>can i keep data private while using CAI?</summary>
      <p>yes. you can run local only scoring, log tension metrics without raw text, and use tiered provenance views for different roles. examples are on <a href="implementations.html">Implementations</a>.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>does CAI require proprietary model weights?</summary>
      <p>no. CAI is model agnostic. it instruments the pipeline and sources you already use.</p>
    </details>
