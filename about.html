  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="lede">The origins of Compression-Aware Intelligence (CAI), and the path that led to its formulation.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>A pattern hiding in plain sight</h2>
    <p>CAI began with a simple observation: every system compresses. From machine learning models reducing reality into tokens, to human beings reducing their lives into narratives, compression shapes what we see and what we miss. Yet while we celebrated the power of these systems, we rarely asked: what is lost in the compression, and how can we measure it?</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>The path to CAI</h2>
    <p>I studied business and computer science at Cornell, worked as a software engineer intern at Meta, and supported legal teams at Cruise and LeaseAccelerator. Across these roles—technical, legal, and organizational—I kept encountering the same issue: outputs were convincing but brittle, polished but ungrounded. Whether it was a contract clause, a machine learning prediction, or a corporate strategy, the hidden compressions shaped the errors.</p>
    <p>Mapping these “compression sites” and their costs became a personal project. What began as notes on contradictions and failure cases grew into a framework with definitions, scores, and reproducible metrics: Compression-Aware Intelligence.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Why release it</h2>
    <p>CAI is not a finished product, but a foundation others can build on. That is why I’ve released the definitions, metrics, and prototype repos openly. My goal is for researchers, engineers, and policymakers to use CAI as a lens for their own work—so that accountability and reliability become default, not afterthoughts.</p>
    <p>If the framework proves useful, the credit belongs to the community that tests, applies, and refines it. I see my role as providing the compass: pointing to compression, and showing why awareness of it matters.</p>

    <h2>Guiding belief</h2>
    <blockquote class="muted">If you can point to the compression, you can reason about the error.</blockquote>
    <p>This is the principle behind CAI. It is also the reason I believe recognition will come not from promotion, but from the clarity the framework gives to others’ work.</p>
