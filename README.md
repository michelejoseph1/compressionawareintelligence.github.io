# Compression Aware Intelligence (CAI)

Every system compresses so real intelligence must be compression-aware.

This repo hosts the public site for CAI. CAI gives where failure pressure comes from (compression), how to measure it (CFI), how it accumulates (CTS), how contradictions emerge (Contradiction Fields), and how to visualize/surface it (Mirror Flags).
